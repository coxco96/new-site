    <p>Remote sensing data is anything but pretty. It's traditionally difficult to map raster data due to the large file sizes of geoTIFFs.</p>
    <p>For this map, I learned how to use Google Earth Engine to calculate the average land surface temperature of Miami-Dade County using data from each day of summer 2021. I exported the data as a geoTIFF and brought the large file into QGIS, where I trimmed the data precision, aggregated similar values, and recast my raster data as vector data. From here, I exported a geoJSON file and brought that file into Flourish.</p>
    <p>I chose the color scheme carefully for this map, staying away from reds to avoid alarmism. This color palette was ultimately selected for accessibility and intuitive thematic communication.</p>
